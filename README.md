# Morserino Phrases trainer

This "Phrases Trainer" works with a Morserino-32.  The Morserino-32 must have firmware V2.3 or above.
When you connect the Morserino-32 to your PC using a USB cable, a serial COM port will appear in the Windows Device Manager.

This app "Phrases Trainer" will send morse code to the user, and the user must echo the code sent using an actual key connected to the Morserino-32.  The "Phrases Trainer" app will decode the morse code that the user sent back, and grade the results.

Troubleshooting the "Phrases Trainer":
1. You must have the appropriate serial USB drivers available on your windows PC before the PC will assign a COM port to the Morserino-32.  Please visit https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers to download the latest USB driver for the computer.

2. The Morserino must be firmware updated to version 3.2.3 or above.  Visit https://github.com/oe1wkl/Morserino-32 to download the latest firmware for the Morserino-32
